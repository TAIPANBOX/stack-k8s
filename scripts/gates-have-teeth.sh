# Checks that the gates in `scripts/` still FAIL on the faults they exist to
# catch, still PASS on what they must not catch, and REFUSE to report success
# when they measured nothing at all.
#
# WHY
#
# Every gate here parses text, and a text parser does not break loudly: it
# stops matching and reports success. The mutants that proved each one existed
# as prose, in commit messages and in the `*(gate: ...)*` markers in CLAUDE.md,
# which is a record of what was true once. Nothing ran them again.
#
# A gate that has quietly stopped catching anything looks exactly like a gate
# with nothing to catch, and stays that way until the fault it guards ships.
#
# WHY THE THIRD PROPERTY IS SEPARATE FROM THE FIRST
#
# Because in this repository it found a real hole, the first one the harness
# has found anywhere in the estate.
#
# `pinned-images.sh` printed "OK: 0 image references, all pinned, built here,
# or allowed by name" and exited 0 on a tree where `manifests/*.yaml` matched
# no file. Renaming the manifests to .yml, or moving them into a subdirectory,
# is ordinary housekeeping, and either one silently turned a check on eleven
# images into a check on none, while printing a sentence that asserts the
# opposite. Fixed in the commit before this one; the case below is what keeps
# it fixed.
#
# Two of the other three already refuse on an absent subject and say so. Those
# sentences were true, established by hand once, and nothing re-ran them.
#
# HOW IT MUTATES WITHOUT LEAVING A MESS
#
# It edits tracked files in place, so it refuses to start unless the tree is
# clean, restores with `git checkout` after every case, restores again from a
# trap on any exit path including a kill, and asserts the tree is clean before
# reporting success.
#
#
# A GATE THAT IS ALREADY FAILING CANNOT BE JUDGED
#
# No case proves anything if the gate was already failing before the mutation.
# So every case runs the gate on the UNMUTATED tree first and reports
# UNJUDGEABLE. Found on 2026-08-09 in it-rat, where one gate was legitimately
# red and a case against it would have been indistinguishable from a working
# one.
#
# It covered only the fail-cases at first, which left the mirror of the same
# bug: on a red gate a pass-case reports OVEREAGER, "the gate failed on
# something it must not catch", and sends the reader to look at a harmless
# mutation. The verdict was being given without the predicate it depends on.
#
# A MUTATION THAT DID NOT APPLY PROVES NOTHING
#
# Every edit asserts it changed the file. A case whose edit applied nothing is
# a failure here, not a pass. That is not hypothetical: five such mutations
# were caught across idryx and tokenfuse on 2026-08-09, and three of the five
# had been verified BY HAND against the same gate minutes earlier. The hand
# version and the harness version differ only in how many layers of quoting sit
# between the text and python, which is exactly the difference nobody sees.
